![Image of the home page](/src/media/readme-img.jpg)

This is the repository for my second year exam project at Noroff. The goal for this project was to create a booking site for a fictional company called Holidaze. The site is built with React and styled components and uses a school provided API to get and post data. The site is responsive and works on all screen sizes.

## Project description

For this project I was tasked with creating a responsive site for a fictional booking company called Holidaze. The project brief outlined several user stories that had to be implemented in the site. Some of the functionality required to fulfil these user stories were:

- Display a list of venues(API results)
- Display a specific venue by id
- A calendar function to view available dates for a specific venue
- Log in and registration functionality for users with a @stud.noroff.no email address
- Displaying a users up coming bookings
- Allowing users to register as venue managers and add their own venues to the site
- Let venue managers edit and delete their venues
- Allowing venue managers to view bookings for their venues
- Allowing a registered user to update their avatar image

A list of technical restrictions were also given for the project. These were:

1. Use an approved Javascript framework (React)
2. Use an approved CSS framework (Styled components)
3. Host the site on an approved static host (Netlify)
